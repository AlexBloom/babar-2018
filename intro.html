<h1>Letter from Staff & Board</h1>

<p>Another year in the books! 2018 was our 16th year on the road, and boy it was sweet. Our 5 teams did what we do best all summer long - eat, sleep, bike, and build. </p>
<p>This year was a year of growth, exploration, and problem solving for Bike & Build. Our 3 week Coastal Drift route was expanded to a full South to North cross-country ride, Keys to Canada. We organized two alumni rides, and are in the planning stages of another. We partnered with two marathons for alumni to run to raise money for Bike & Build.</p>
<p>Bike & Build has been experiencing some financial dilemmas since we cut our routes down in 2017 - we have been working hard to find solutions and ease our woes. We launched an alumni giving campaign, have continued growing our partnerships, and have hunkered down to fill our 2019 teams! </p>
<p>As a staff and board, we have nothing but energy and excitement moving forward to 2019 and beyond. </p>

<p>In spandex, </p>
