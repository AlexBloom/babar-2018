      <h3>Every Rider, Every Year</h3>
      <p>This year we launched an alumni giving campaign, Every Rider, Every Year. This campaign’s goal is to engage our alumni from past years to help support Bike & Build’s sustainability for years to come. Since the campaign’s launch in mid-2018 we are projected to raise over $60,000, and we think that’s pretty amazing. </p>
      <p>So far, over 440 alumni have supported us through recurring monthly donations, yearly donations, and special fundraising events. We are far from reaching our annual goal of $200,000 but have laid the groundwork for maximizing this campaign as we move forward. </p>
      <p>Thank you to each and every supporter of Every Rider, Every Year!</p>

      <p>Roots of Renewal NOLA is a community development nonprofit located in New Orleans, focusing on the successful re-entry of formerly incarcerated young adults, the elimination of blight and decay in New Orleans, as well as the creation of affordable housing projects. 2019 finds the organization putting the finishing touches on their 2nd piece of renovated property in the 7th ward of New Orleans, providing a new home for a deserving family.</p>
      <p>The grant given to Roots of Renewal came at a crucial time for the organization, allowing them to purchase necessary components for finishing the renovation of a previously abandoned property. With this property completed, Roots of Renewal NOLA will continue to help build affordable housing in the New Orleans area, while continuing to help formerly incarcerated young men reintegrate back into society.</p>
      <blockquote>“These funds were a blessing that we could never express enough gratitude for. The fact that Bike & Build cares enough about our organization and our community is incredible”, said Executive Director Kat Rieder. “We are honored and privileged to have been considered by your riders as an organization to receive these hard earned fundraised dollars.”</blockquote>

They currently have 16 paid high school apprentices building a 1300 sq foot single family home in New Orleans’ historic Treme neighborhood, which will be sold at at an affordable rate through a local partnership. </p>
      <blockquote>“The funding we’ve received from Bike & Build is playing a critical role in the way unCommon Construction develops a sense of team unity and belonging amongst our high school apprentices”, said Executive Director Aaron Frumin. The partnership between unCommon Construction and Bike & Build has continued to grow over the years, as they have been both a grant recipient and build site host for our Southern route multiple times. “Bike & Builders who served as volunteers were awesome, enthusiastic mentors for high school apprentices, giving them a sense of the kinds of world-expanding opportunities they might reach in the future”. </blockquote>

Upon completion, 56 single room occupancy units will be available and ready to support and provide shelter to many women in need.</p>
      <p>Abby’s House will be using the Bike & Build grant funds to continue to provide women and children who are at risk of being homeless with safe, supportive housing that will allow them to rebuild their lives.

      <h3>Philadelphia Marathon </h3>
      <p>In November, we partnered with the Philadelphia Marathon to create Team Bike & Build. The team of 24 alumni & friends ran a collective 393 miles in the name of affordable housing and raised nearly $10,000 for Bike & Build's Every Rider, Every Year Campaign. One alum ran the full marathon in his camelbak and safety triangle! That's commitment.</p>
      <p>Dozens of alumni came out to help serve and host a pasta dinner, to cheer along the route, and to celebrate the big accomplishments of our runners.</p>
      <p>Watching people finish a race is always a joyous occasion, but it was extra special and heartwarming to have so many of our alumni commit to a personal goal, see them cross the finish line, and dedicate their efforts to Bike & Build.</p>

      <p>Since the Philadelphia Marathon was such a wonderful event, we have partnered with the Colfax Marathon in Denver this coming May. We are looking forward to Team Bike & Build for a second time, running for affordable housing, making new friends, and re-engaging with the organization.</p>

  </h2>
  <p>As we prepare for the 2019 summer, we will be riding 3 cross-country routes: Northern US, Central US, and Southern US. Drift West continues as our 3-week regional route up in the stunning Pacific Northwest. We look forward to continuing to offer more alumni rides, as the Lone Star Loop through the Texas Hill Country was such a success. This summer we will offer a week long ride on the coast of California to better engage our West Coast alumni!</p>
  <p>We plan on continuing to find more opportunities like the Philadelphia and Colfax Marathons to partner with, as they provide not only meaningful engagement with Bike & Build and the alumni community, but help us diversify our revenue sources. </p>
  <p>As an organization we continue to structure our 5 year Strategic Plan. A major pillar that Bike & Build will be focusing on is Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We feel that honing in on DE&I is not only a crucial step for the organization, but will also help us better reflect our values and mission. Diversity amongst our organization on all levels will allow us to grow stronger in numerous areas; with diversity comes greater range of impact on our leaders, riders, hosts, partners, build partners, and grantees. Our first step as an organization is learning how to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion into each layer of what we do here at Bike & Build through outside expertise, trainings, and focusing on individual & organizational understanding. </p>
  <p>We are energetic and enthusiastic to continue pedaling forward.</p>
  <p>Thank you to our 2018 riders and leaders, to our donors, hosts, partners, alumni, friends, and family! We couldn’t do it without y’all!</p>
  <p>Onward and upward!</p>
